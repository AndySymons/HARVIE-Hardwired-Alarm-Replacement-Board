# HARVIE-Hardwired-Alarm-Replacement-Board

This project went through several iterations and variants. I first built one using WiFi to connect to HÄ±ome Assistant, then one using Ethernet (for which I tried several options). I am currently developing an optional battery backup facility that is monitored by Home Assistant.   

For details [see the Wiki](https://github.com/AndySymons/HARVIE-Hardwired-Alarm-Replacement-Board/wiki/Introduction)

This project does not include the use of existing 994x keypads as that requires a proprietary serial data interface protocol for which no documentation is available. I have a separate project to reverse-engineer that protocol and connect one or more keyboards to the same ort a separate ESP32 -- see [project KELLY](https://github.com/AndySymons/KELLY-Scantronic-994x-Keypad).
